        <h1>About Page</h1>
        <p>In order to facilitate the development of applications for mobile devices, and the consistency thereof,
            various
            approaches have been taken.<br><br>Most companies that ship a product(e.g.Apple, iPod / iPhone / iPad)
            provide an
            official software development kit(SDK).They may also opt to provide some form of Testing and / or Quality
            Assurance(QA).In exchange for being provided the SDK or other tools, it may be necessary for a prospective
            developer to
            sign some form of non - disclosure agreement, or NDA, which restricts the sharing of privileged
            information.<br><br>As
            part of the development process, mobile user interface(UI) design is an essential step in the creation of
            mobile
            apps.Mobile UI designers consider constraints, contexts, screen space, input methods, and mobility as
            outlines for
            design.Constraints in mobile UI design, which include the limited attention span of the user and form
            factors such as a
            mobile device's screen size for a user's hand(s).Mobile UI context includes signal cues from user activity,
            such as the
            location where or the time when the device is in use, that can be observed from user interactions within a
            mobile
            app.Such context clues can be used to provide automatic suggestions when scheduling an appointment or
            activity or to
            filter a list of various services for the user.<br><br>The user is often the focus of interaction with their
            device, and
            the interface entails components of both hardware and software.User input allows for the users to manipulate
            a system,
            and the device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users'
            manipulation.<br><br>Overall, mobile UI
            design's goal is mainly for an understandable, user-friendly interface. Functionality is supported by mobile
            enterprise
            application platforms or integrated development environments (IDEs).<br><br>Developers of mobile
            applications must also
            consider a large array of devices with different screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations
            because of
            intense competition in mobile hardware and changes within each of the platforms.<br><br>Today, mobile apps
            are usually
            distributed via an official online outlet or marketplace(e.g.Apple - The App Store, Google - Google Play)
            and there is a
            formalized process by which developers submit their apps for approval and inclusion in those
            marketplaces.Historically,
            however, that was not always the case.<br><br>Mobile UIs, or front - ends, rely on mobile back - ends to
            support access
            to enterprise systems.The mobile back - end facilitates data routing, security, authentication,
            authorization, working
            off - line, and service orchestration.This functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components,
            including
            mobile app servers, mobile backend as a service(MBaaS), and service - oriented architecture(SOA)
            infrastructure.</p>
