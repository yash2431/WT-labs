        <p>Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for one or more mobile
            devices, which
            can include personal digital assistants (PDA), enterprise digital assistants (EDA), or mobile phones.Such
            software
            applications are specifically designed to run on mobile devices, taking numerous hardware constraints into
            consideration. Common constraints include CPU architecture and speeds, available memory (RAM), limited data
            storage
            capacities, and considerable variation in displays (technology, size, dimensions, resolution) and input
            methods
            (buttons, keyboards, touch screens with or without styluses).These applications (or "apps") can be
            pre-installed on
            phones during manufacturing or delivered as web applications, using server-side or client-side processing
            (e.g.,
            JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a web browser.</p>
